                  This workshop was very intriguing. The instructors went to the extra mile by providing us with so much
                  references to books, blogs and talks we could refer to. The most impressive thing was the effort they
                  took to print out research papers and hand out a spiral bound copy to every one!!

                  I mean the kind of commitment they have towards this just swayed us and shows their love for
                  programming
                  and how keen they are towards building a community. This workshop was very inspiring and a significant
                  memory to hold on to.

                  The final product that we were asked to build was amazing. There were plenty of things that

                  platform helped a lot in better understanding of the course and also the faculties, teaching

                  Loved everything about this course.
                  It was great to receive feedback from industry professionals. We learned a lot outside the curriculum
                  while doing the project - Github, CSS, JS, and the assignments were exceptionally good in testing our
                  knowledge about that week's syllabus.

              <h2>Write open-source code for Corona disaster management</h2>
              <p>
                This course is part of the CoronaSafe initiative that will let
                you create open-source software used by government agencies for
                public health and disaster management.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Corona Care software is currently being used in over 100
                hospitals to record patient intake and availability of
                facilities. This results in a central dashboard used by the
                Ernakulam district collectorâ€™s office for monitoring and
                allocating resources. The software is also guided by the Central
                governmentâ€™s National Health Mission.
              </p>

              <p>
                This course is created to find and train students to help contribute to the CoronaSafe open-source

              <h3>Build live, real-world software with Ruby on Rails</h3>

              <p>
                Ruby on Rails pioneered the modern web framework revolution. It
                is a fully integrated package that has everything we need to
                build complete web applications. GitHub is built on Rails and so
                is Shopify. Thousands of startups build their systems in Rails
                every year, and it has also become a mainstream solution for
                large companies.{" "}
              </p>

              <h3>Create advanced front-ends with React and ReScript/OCaml</h3>

              <p>
                Youâ€™ll learn to program in the Typed Functional paradigm in
                ReScript/OCaml. ReScript compiles down to efficient JavaScript
                and has excellent support for building front-end with React.
                During the course you will create everything from simple
                interactive UIs to user input forms, games, and single-page
                applications.
